Based on what I know about you, I’d guess you’d enjoy books that are thought-provoking, challenge conventional thinking, or explore themes of logic, ethics, and human behavior. You might also like books that involve hacking, breaking systems, or subverting expectations. Here are some that seem like they’d be up your alley:

    "The Cuckoo's Egg" by Cliff Stoll – A real-life cybersecurity story about tracking a hacker, mixing technical details with a detective-like narrative.
    "Ghost in the Wires" by Kevin Mitnick – The autobiography of one of the most famous hackers, full of social engineering tricks and breaking security.
    "Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution" by Steven Levy – A history of hacker culture, which might align with your love of using things in unintended ways.
    "The Phoenix Project" by Gene Kim – A novel about DevOps and IT management, but it reads like a thriller and touches on problem-solving and efficiency.
    "The Code Book" by Simon Singh – A history of cryptography that ties into cybersecurity and logic.
    "Gödel, Escher, Bach" by Douglas Hofstadter – A deep dive into logic, patterns, and self-reference that might scratch your discrete math itch.
    "Snow Crash" by Neal Stephenson – A cyberpunk novel that plays with hacking, virtual reality, and information theory.
    "Neuromancer" by William Gibson – The book that basically defined cyberpunk, with hacking, AI, and corporate intrigue.
    "The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene – If you're interested in management, conflict, and human dynamics, this is a ruthless but insightful take.
    "Thinking, Fast and Slow" by Daniel Kahneman – A breakdown of human decision-making, biases, and logic, which might appeal to your analytical side.

Would you say any of these fit? Or do you gravitate toward a different kind of book?
